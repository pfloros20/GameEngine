# GameFramework
The goal is to create a simple cross platform 2D Game Framework using only SDL2 for making games. This project doesn't include a GUI and is not a stand-alone Game Engine. What it does is providing classes which can be used to draw Pictures and Sprites on the screen, play audio and receive input without requiring any SDL2 knowledge.

## Setup
**This project requires having the SDL2 library installed.**
It is currently developed on Microsoft Visual Studio and just by downloading the software and running the solution file you can have the project up and running. For people who don't use Visual Studio, there is a cmake file to create the makefile for compiling the code.
